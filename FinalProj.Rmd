## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


break down by party and gender 
```{r Summary Statistics}
anti_a <- anti_abort_replication_leg_party_compet_28Jan20

# ideology scale summary 
summary(anti_a$IPG8)

# populations proportions of party and gender
table(anti_a$Female, anti_a$party)

pro_all <- subset(anti_a,bin_pro_all == 1)

anti_a$gender_party <- NA
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 1 & anti_a$party == "D"] <- "Dem. Woman"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 1 & anti_a$party == "R"] <- "Rep. Woman"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 0 & anti_a$party == "D"] <- "Dem. Man"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 0 & anti_a$party == "R"] <- "Rep. Man"

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
$$ antifetus = mx + b$$


```{r main regression, echo=FALSE}
# regression: trying to regress 
lm(anti_a$Female ~ anti_a$bin_anti_fetus)
# 1% chance of being female increasing support for anti abortion with fetus bill

#two way table


dem_fem <- subset(anti_a, Female == 1 & party == "D")
dem_male<- subset(anti_a, Female == 0 & party == "D")
rep_fem <- subset(anti_a, Female == 1 & party == "R")
rep_male <- subset(anti_a, Female == 0 & party == "R")


gender_party_means <- tapply(anti_a$bin_anti_all, anti_a$gender_party, mean)
party_means <- tapply(anti_a$bin_anti_all, anti_a$party, mean)
IPG8_means <- tapply(anti_a$IPG8, anti_a$gender_party, mean)
hist(x = dem_fem$IPG8, freq = FALSE)
hist(x = dem_male$IPG8, freq = FALSE)
hist(x = rep_fem$IPG8, freq = FALSE)
hist(x = reo_male$IPG8, freq = FALSE)

barplot(gender_party_means,
        main = "Distribution of Voting for Anti-Abortion Bills by Gender and Party",
        xlab = "Party and Gender",
        ylab = "Distribution",
        col = "steelblue2",
        border = "white")
barplot(party_means,
        main = "Distribution of Anti-Abortion Bill Votes by Party",
        xlab = "Party",
        ylab = "Distribution",
        col = "indianred",
        border = "white")
barplot(IPG8_means,
        main = "Distribution of IPG8 Scores by Party and Gender",
        xlab = "Gender and Party",
        ylab = "IPG8 Score",
        col = "dodgerblue",
        border = "white")



# regress both gender and party onto bill votes


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
